      "description": "Every AI logo generator creates raster images (PNG/JPG). These images lose quality when scaled, look blurry on large displays, and can't be cleanly edited in vector design tools. To use an AI-generated logo professionally — on business cards, banners, merchandise, or websites — you need a vector version.",
      "problem": "The Problem",
      "problemDescription": "AI logo generators only output raster files. Raster images are not scalable, not suitable for high-resolution printing, and difficult to edit. Hiring a graphic designer to manually recreate the logo as a vector costs money and takes time.",
